Description: 

	Hello, I'm Jorge. You see, I developed this project using just
	javascript code. The previous project that I made ('Project-01-Books')
	I used only HTML and CSS, but now, I developed all the website
	using only Javascript.
	
	Take a look and see this project. All the information and files you
	will find on this repository.

Have a wonderful day! :smiley:
